Legacy RB & C3 charts from other authors: 

These are RB2cons that were originally RB3cons from the C3/Rhythmverse database from other authors and have been converted to RB2, DIY multitracks added and some chart tweaks here and there. I will also never upload these to RV since these charts are not mine.

Original charts made by U628:

These are RB2cons that are created by me from scratch. These are also available on RV for the people who are unaware of this repo.

RB3cons: 

these songs are also for the most part original charts by me but these have upgraded venues and some songs might have Pro Keys/Pro Strings, Obviously these are for RB3 only.
